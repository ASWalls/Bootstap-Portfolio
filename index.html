                <p>I’m a developer-in-training and recent graduate of the University of Arizona,
                    where I earned two very pragmatic and highly career-focused degrees in philosophy
                    and linguistics, which are actually super interesting and relevant to- wait,
                    where are you going?</p>
                <p>I have far too many hobbies to list here. My meta-hobbies include: researching
                    new hobbies, quickly discarding new hobbies should I not find them enjoyable
                    (fail quickly!), and purchasing books on my existing hobbies so that visitors
                    to my apartment can see how serious and scholarly I am.</p>
                <p>Writing code began as yet another fleeting interest, but by virtue of the
                    incredible depth and breadth of knowledge to acquire and the impressive amount
                    of money waiting for those who acquire it, I’ve found more than enough to keep
                    me in it for the long haul. It felt like magic, at first, to draw back the
                    curtains on the machines that have run my life since I was old enough to operate
                    a keyboard and finding something so complex, so messy, and so beautiful—then I
                    realized I could conjure the stuff myself, and I was hooked.</p>
